Bring Up PredictionIO VM with Vagrant
======================================

Vagrant is an open source tool for simplifying the download and setup steps of a virtual machine (VM) with VirtualBox. It is recommended for a quick PredictionIO installation in a testing or development environment, as it will save you from many of the common pitfalls of the installation process.

Please refer to our [documentation site](http://docs.prediction.io/current/installation/install-predictionio-with-virtualbox-vagrant.html) for detailed usage and setup.
